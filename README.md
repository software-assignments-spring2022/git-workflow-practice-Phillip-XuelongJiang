# [Crypto Trading Bots and the Emergence of Trading Intelligence](https://betterprogramming.pub/crypto-trading-bots-and-the-emergence-of-trading-intelligence-27104e7cbf84)

A relatively short introduction to automatic cryptocurrency trading, this article explains the development and function of "trading bots", software that automatically executes trading strategies in financial markets, from "the bird's eye view". 
It piqued my interest because as an amateur investor, I would like to develop my own trading bots to test out my strategies, but I didn't know where to start.
This article has provided me a general framework to start with: design and code my trading algorithm, connect to various exchanges through apis, visualize data trends, backtesting with historical market data, etc.

While many concepts might sound elementary, it definitely encouraged me to take the plunge into automatic trading. I strongly recommend this article to anyone of similiar interests.
